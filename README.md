### What I learned

By using Vanilla JS to create interactivity, I refreshed my memory when it comes to manipulating the DOM; used some not previously known methods, such as the very useful "customValidity" function:

```js
email_input.setCustomValidity("Invalid field.");
```
and the "replaceWith" function

```js
presentation_card.replaceWith(confirmation_card);
```
